                <div class="bio-para">
                    <p>Coming from a third world country and as a first generation immigrant in the US, 
                    I am always humble, hungry and grateful  for who I am and what I have become so far. I am always seeking
                    a way to give back and contribute to the community and the organization that have supported to my growth. 
                    Growth mindset is something I truly  believe in. I embrace failure  and make the most out of it. 
                    I am a persistent, highly-motivated and passionate learner. I enjoy solving problems and building things. 
                    Naturally, I chose to become an engineer, particularly chose Computer Science which I am very glad that I did. 
                    CS Major has been such a fulfilling  field of study for me. 
                    Now that I am a few months away from being able to be in the industry, I am even more excited!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> My name is Myo(ME-O) Aung. I am currently majoring in Computer Science at California 
                        State Polytechnic University, Pomona. My current GPA is 3.72. 
                        My coursework and internship experience exposed me to a wide range of programming languages, software development methodologies, 
                        and problem-solving techniques. 
                        I excelled in subjects such as data structures, algorithms, and database management systems, 
                        which I believe are crucial for a successful software engineer.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> As a professional, I am always prepared to bring value to the table. 
                        What truly sets me apart is my passion for continuous learning and innovation. I am an enthusiastic learner who is always eager to explore new technologies and skills.
                        I believe that staying up-to-date with industry trends and best practices is essential for a software engineer's success, and I am committed to investing the time and effort required to stay at the forefront of this ever-evolving field  </p>
